## Description

The Python Information Gathering Script is a Python program designed to collect information about a target domain. It performs various information gathering tasks, including domain information lookup, DNS footprinting, web footprinting (fetching the webpage title), network and WHOIS enumeration, and open-source intelligence (OSINT).

## Features

- Retrieve domain information using WHOIS lookup.
- Perform DNS footprinting to get the IP address of the target domain.
- Fetch the title of the target webpage using web footprinting.
- Conduct network enumeration using the `nslookup` command.
- Placeholder for performing open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Python Information Gathering Script.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `whois` library (install using `pip install python-whois`).
- The `requests` library (install using `pip install requests`).
- The `beautifulsoup4` library (install using `pip install beautifulsoup4`).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/information-gathering-script.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder

    ```
    cd information-gathering-script
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```
    python information_gathering.py
    ```

4. Usage

    Run the script as instructed above.
